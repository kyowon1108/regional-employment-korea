# Archived Code

This directory contains code that was developed during the project lifecycle but is no longer actively used.

## Contents

### `src/` - Original Modular Structure
- **Purpose**: Originally designed as a structured modular approach for the analysis
- **Status**: Superseded by `comprehensive_employment_analysis.py`
- **Reason for archiving**: The single-file approach proved more practical for this specific analysis

### `code_docs/` - Technical Documentation
- **Purpose**: Documentation for the modular code structure
- **Status**: No longer relevant due to code structure changes
- **Reason for archiving**: Documentation no longer matches current codebase

## Architecture Decision

The project evolved from a structured modular approach to a single-file script approach because:

1. **Simplicity**: Single analysis script is easier to understand and modify
2. **Current Use Case**: Project focuses on specific employment analysis rather than general-purpose analytics platform
3. **Maintenance**: Single file requires less maintenance overhead
4. **Collaboration**: Easier for researchers to understand and replicate analysis

## Restoration

If needed, these archived components can be restored and integrated back into the main codebase.
